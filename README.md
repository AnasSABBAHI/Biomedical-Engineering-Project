# Acinus Oxygen Diffusion Model

A computational model for simulating oxygen diffusion in pulmonary acinus using finite difference methods with various boundary conditions.

## Project Overview

This project models oxygen transport in the pulmonary acinus, the functional unit of the lung where gas exchange occurs. The model solves the diffusion equation under different physiological conditions and boundary regimes.

### Key Features

- **Stationary Regime**: Steady-state oxygen diffusion
- **Quasi-Stationary Regime**: Time-dependent diffusion with breathing
- **COPD Pathology**: Deformed domain modeling for disease simulation
- **Multiple Boundary Conditions**: Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin conditions
- **Parameter Studies**: Screening length effects and flux analysis
