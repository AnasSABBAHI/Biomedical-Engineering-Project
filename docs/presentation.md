## Introduction
- Pulmonary acinus: functional gas exchange unit
- Oxygen transport occurs via diffusion
- Complex 3D structure simplified to 2D model
- Clinical relevance: COPD, emphysema

---
## Problem Statement
**How does oxygen diffuse through acinar structure?**

Objectives:
1. Model stationary diffusion
2. Simulate breathing dynamics
3. Analyze pathological conditions (COPD)
4. Quantify screening effects

---
## Mathematical Framework

### Diffusion Equation
\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 C
\]

### Stationary Case
\[
\nabla^2 C = 0
\]

### Boundary Conditions
- **Dirichlet:** \( C = C_a - C_b \) (alveolar surface)
- **Robin:** \( \frac{\partial C}{\partial n} = -\frac{C}{\Lambda} \) (capillary)
- **Neumann:** \( \frac{\partial C}{\partial n} = 0 \) (sides)

---
## Numerical Implementation

### Finite Difference Method
\[
\frac{C_{i+1,j} + C_{i-1,j} + C_{i,j+1} + C_{i,j-1} - 4C_{i,j}}{h^2} = 0
\]

### Linear System
\[
A\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{b}
\]

- Sparse matrix formulation
- Efficient numerical solvers
- Adaptive grid refinement

## Stationary Regime Results

### Concentration Field

**Key observations:**
- Smooth concentration gradients
- Maximum at alveolar surface
- Screening effects visible
- Flux depends on Λ parameter

## Screening Effect Analysis

### Oxygen Flux vs Screening Length

**Findings:**
- Flux ∝ 1/Λ for small Λ
- Screening length critical parameter
- Optimal Λ ≈ 0.28 m for human acinus
- Explains acinar size constraints

---
## Quasi-Stationary Regime

### Breathing Dynamics
Boundary condition:
\[
C(x,y=L) = C_a - C_b + C_1(\cos\omega t - 1)
\]

### Time-Dependent Results

**Features:**
- Periodic concentration variations
- Flux oscillations at breathing frequency
- Phase shifts in different regions

## COPD Pathology Modeling

### Domain Deformation
