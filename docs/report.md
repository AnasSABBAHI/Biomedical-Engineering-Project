## Abstract
This project develops a computational model to simulate oxygen diffusion in the pulmonary acinus, the functional unit of the lung where gas exchange occurs. We solve the diffusion equation under various physiological conditions using finite difference methods, examining both stationary and quasi-stationary regimes. The model incorporates realistic boundary conditions and explores pathological conditions such as COPD.

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Physiological Context
The pulmonary acinus is the fundamental gas exchange unit in mammalian lungs, consisting of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli. Oxygen transport from alveolar air to pulmonary capillaries occurs primarily through diffusion across tissue barriers. Understanding this process is crucial for modeling respiratory physiology and pathology.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
We aim to model oxygen diffusion in a 2D representation of the acinus, solving the diffusion equation with mixed boundary conditions that reflect physiological constraints. The model addresses:
- Stationary diffusion under constant conditions
- Quasi-stationary diffusion with breathing dynamics
- Pathological modifications in COPD

## 2 Mathematical Model

### 2.1 Governing Equations
The general diffusion equation is:

\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 C
\]

Where:
- \( C \) = oxygen concentration (mol/m³)
- \( D \) = diffusion coefficient (m²/s)
- \( t \) = time (s)

### 2.2 Stationary Regime
For steady-state conditions:

\[
\nabla^2 C = \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial y^2} = 0
\]

### 2.3 Boundary Conditions

#### Dirichlet Condition (Alveolar Surface):
\[
C(x, y = L) = C_a - C_b
\]

#### Robin Condition (Capillary Interface):
\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial n} = -\frac{C}{\Lambda}
\]

#### Neumann Conditions (Lateral Boundaries):
\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial n} = 0
\]

### 2.4 Physical Parameters
| Parameter | Symbol | Value | Unit |
|-----------|--------|-------|------|
| Alveolar O₂ concentration | \( C_a \) | 8.4 | mol/m³ |
| Blood O₂ concentration | \( C_b \) | 5.1×10⁻⁴ | mol/m³ |
| Screening length | \( \Lambda \) | 0.28 | m |
| Diffusion coefficient | \( D \) | 1.8×10⁻⁹ | m²/s |
| Breathing frequency | \( \omega \) | 1.88 | rad/s |

## 3 Numerical Methods

### 3.1 Finite Difference Discretization
The Laplace operator is discretized using central differences:

\[
\nabla^2 C_{i,j} \approx \frac{C_{i+1,j} + C_{i-1,j} + C_{i,j+1} + C_{i,j-1} - 4C_{i,j}}{h^2}
\]

### 3.2 Linear System Formulation
The discretized equations form a linear system:

\[
A \mathbf{C} = \mathbf{b}
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is the coefficient matrix incorporating boundary conditions
- \( \mathbf{C} \) is the vector of unknown concentrations
- \( \mathbf{b} \) contains boundary condition information

### 3.3 Implementation Details
The system is solved using sparse matrix methods for computational efficiency. The domain is discretized into a regular grid with typical resolution of 100×100 points.

## 4 Results and Analysis

### 4.1 Stationary Regime
The stationary solution shows characteristic concentration profiles with highest values at the alveolar surface and decreasing toward the capillary interface. The screening length parameter \( \Lambda \) significantly influences the oxygen flux.

### 4.2 Screening Effect Analysis
We observe the "diffusional screening" phenomenon where oxygen preferentially diffuses to regions closest to the source. The screening length \( \Lambda \) represents the characteristic distance over which concentration gradients develop.

### 4.3 Quasi-Stationary Regime
Time-dependent simulations reveal periodic concentration variations corresponding to breathing cycles. The flux oscillates with the breathing frequency, with maximum values during inspiration.

### 4.4 COPD Pathology Modeling
In pathological conditions simulating COPD:
- Deformed domains show concentration deficits
- Oxygen flux is reduced by 30-50%
- Screening effects are amplified in deformed regions

## 5 Discussion

### 5.1 Physiological Relevance
The model successfully captures key features of pulmonary gas exchange:
- Realistic concentration gradients
- Appropriate flux magnitudes
- Physiologically plausible screening effects

### 5.2 Clinical Implications
The COPD simulations demonstrate how structural changes in emphysema impair gas exchange efficiency. This provides insight into the physiological basis of hypoxemia in obstructive lung diseases.

### 5.3 Model Limitations
- 2D approximation of 3D geometry
- Homogeneous tissue properties assumed
- Simplified boundary conditions
- Constant diffusion coefficient

## 6 Conclusion

We have developed a robust computational framework for modeling oxygen diffusion in the pulmonary acinus. The model successfully simulates both normal and pathological conditions, providing insights into the mechanisms of gas exchange impairment in lung diseases.
